# Vanilla VAE with classifier guidance

## Requirements
This code should run well on any hardware.

## **Task description**

The task consists of 2 parts:

1. Find bugs in a training code for a simple classifier;
2. Write code for optimizing VAE output with classifier guidance.
    This means that VAE should produce the number that we are asking for. You should use pre-trained classifier for that in this setup.
